        The purpose of this resource is to allow the submission of a request to

        This request will be validated and processed asynchronously - failures
        will be updated in the event/activity log.

      These values describe what can be answer values must or should be supplied
      on a subsequent problem report submission.


      Question Type


      A question with a question type value of standard are required to be
      supplied in a problem report submission to ensure a valid problem report


      In some situations a standard question will be specified with a
      listOfValues answerType with values of "Yes" and "No", this is used to
      further restrict the boolean values allowed in a subsequent submission.


      The subsequent submission of standard question/answer details is as
      defined in the problem report submission defintion, and non boolean values
      should be translated into a compliant question submission.


      A question with a question type value of non standard are required to be
      supplied in a problem report submission to ensure Chorus has all
      supporting 

      information to aid the resolution process and allow the submission of
      answers to non-boolean questions
